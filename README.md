# reusefull
https://reusefull.org/ is a website that connects people with stuff they no longer need with nonprofit organizations that could use it.

## Problem Statement

Many people have excess stuff that could still be put to good use but don't know what organizations might accept it. Nonprofit organizations need to stretch their budgets, but people have to know about the organizations in order to check their website or social media to learn about what types of in-kind donations an organization might need. Nonprofits often get in-kind donations they don't need or have issues with storing large amounts of donations they do need. 

## Stakeholders
* People who donate unneeded household items
* Nonprofit organizations that accept in-kind donations
* Organizations that serve nonprofits, such as Nonprofit Connect and United Way
